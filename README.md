# Goyave Template

A template project to get started with the [Goyave](https://github.com/go-goyave/goyave) framework.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Go 1.21

### Running the project

First, make your own configuration for your local environment. You can copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`.

Run `go run main.go` in your project's directory to start the server, then try to request the `users` route.
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/users
$ curl http://localhost:8080/users?page=2
$ curl http://localhost:8080/users?page=2&perPage=100
```
